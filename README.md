# hf-agents-gaia
Final project for the Hugging Face Agents course â€” building and evaluating a custom AI agent on the GAIA benchmark.

## Introduction

This repository contains my final project for the Hugging Face Agents Course. The goal of the assignment is to design, build, and evaluate an AI agent capable of solving a set of tasks based on a subset of the GAIA benchmark. The agent must achieve a performance score of 30% or higher to successfully complete the course and earn certification.

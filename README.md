# hf-agents-gaia
Final project for the Hugging Face Agents course ‚Äî building and evaluating a custom AI agent on the GAIA benchmark.

## Introduction

This repository contains my final project for the Hugging Face Agents Course. The goal of the assignment is to design, build, and evaluate an AI agent capable of solving a set of tasks based on a subset of the GAIA benchmark. The agent must achieve a performance score of 30% or higher to successfully complete the course and earn certification.

This project builds upon the initial template provided by the [Hugging Face Agents Course Template](https://huggingface.co/spaces/agents-course/Final_Assignment_Template/tree/main) repository.
